# Subnetting Calculator
This project is under active development as I work to re-learn C
after almost 15 years of atrophy. Figured I would start with something
simple, useful, and fun. The goal is to provide simple IPv4 subnetting
support using a variety of C basic skills like conditionals, iteration,
pointers, makefiles, and more.
